---Gabe and Bruce's Project D Submission---
The associated project contains a basic operating system 
that meets all the requirements listed in the Project D
instructions.
    All steps, one through six, were completed.
Step 1 (write sector) and Step 4 (write a file) are
demonstrated to work in other steps. Step 2 is demonstrated
when the user enters in "dir" to the command line. All
files on the disk's directory will be listed.
Deleting a file (step 3) can be done in a manner that does
not hurt the project's files if the "del" command is 
entered after steps 5 and 6, copying and creating, respectively.
The "copy" command must be used after the "create" command
to demonstrate or test file creation in a non-destructive manner.
